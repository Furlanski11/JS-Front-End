In the "JS Front-End" course, participants will acquire fundamental knowledge of the JavaScript language, covering syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions.
The course aims to develop algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, participants will be able to work with the Document Object Model (DOM), perform manipulations on it, and handle events.
Functional and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approaches in JavaScript programming will be explored. Concepts related to data transmission through HTTP and REST will also be studied.
